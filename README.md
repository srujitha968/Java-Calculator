# Java Console Calculator
This a simple console based calculator which will perform 4 basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division based on user input.
The input is taken from the user using the Scanner class through the console.

# How it Works
1. A while loop is used to continuously display the operation menu to the user.
2. The user selects an option, and the input is processed using a switch statement.
3. Based on the selected option, the corresponding operation is performed.
4. The loop keeps running and displaying the options until the user chooses to exit the program.

# Input Validation
1. If the user enters anything other than a number, the program shows an error message and the program will stop running.
2. For division, the program checks if the divisor is zero and prompts the user to enter a valid number.
